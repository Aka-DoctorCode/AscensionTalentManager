# Ascension Talent Manager

Is a simple, minimalistic and context-aware add on to manage your talents in retail **World of Warcraft**.

It automatically detects the "context" (type of zone) you are entering (Open World, Dungeon, Raid, Delve, or PvP) and prompts you to change to your active talent loadout for that specific activity.

Designed to be lightweight and non-intrusive, it ensures you never start a fight without the right talents.
