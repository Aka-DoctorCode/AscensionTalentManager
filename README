# Ascension Talent Manager

Ascension Talent Manager is a lightweight, context-aware World of Warcraft addon designed to ensure you always have the optimal talent loadout for your current activity. 

Whether you are entering a Mythic+ dungeon, a raid, or simply exploring the open world, the addon detects the transition and prompts you to switch to your preferred setup instantly.
